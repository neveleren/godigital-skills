# GoDigital Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Skill

This skill provides Claude with GoDigital's Ideal Customer Profile for sales, marketing, and customer-facing activities.

---

## Quick Definition

The ICP Buyer Persona is a **commercially-minded decision maker in a mid-sized DACH company** suffering from acute skill shortages, manual routine tasks, and missing process documentation. They seek a **small, low-risk entry solution** with which they can demonstrate a clearly measurable ROI for a routine process in ≤30 days - without long-term commitment to a SaaS provider.

## Who We Serve

### Company Type

- **Location:** DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
- **Industries:** High administrative burden with many standard cases:
  - Property management / Real estate management
  - Financial and insurance services
  - Technical services
  - Professional services (tax advisors, engineering firms)
  - Manufacturing SMEs with strong back-office
- **Company Size:** 50-500 employees, with 5-50 in administrative/routine-heavy areas (accounting, back-office, customer service, dispatch)
- **Growth Stage:** Growth or structural change (acquisitions, regulatory pressure, digitization requirements)

### Tech Landscape

- ERP/Finance system present (DATEV, SAP, Microsoft, industry solutions)
- Additional tools: Email, Excel, partial DMS/CRM
- **No continuous process or automation framework**
- First automation attempts (RPA, macros, small scripts) present but fragmented and not scaled
- Willing to use cloud or on-prem solutions if data sovereignty and compliance guaranteed

### Organizational Maturity

- Processes exist but are **barely documented** or only in outdated documents
- Strong dependency on 2-5 "old hands" with 10+ years tenure
- High proportion of manual data entry, copy-paste, checking, post-processing

---

## Decision Makers (Buyer Persona)

### Job Titles

- Geschäftsführer / Owner of mid-sized companies
- Kaufmännischer Leiter, CFO, Head of Finance & Controlling
- Head of Operations / COO
- Department Head Back-office, Shared Services, Accounting

### Responsibilities

- P&L responsibility or direct budget authority
- Personnel costs and productivity in administrative areas
- Compliance and deadline adherence (closings, regulatory reports, utility bills)
- Stability of critical business processes (invoice processing, contract management, master data maintenance)

### Mindset

- **Pragmatist, NOT an AI hype fan**
- Distrustful of "big AI projects," consultants, and unclear ROI promises
- Thinks in clear numbers and payback periods (≤12 months, preferably ≤6 months)
- Wants to "see a small working system first" before discussing larger programs
- Sees AI as a tool for scaling the existing team, not as an end in itself

---

## Three Central Pain Points

### Pain Point #1 - AI & IT Investments Without Clear ROI

- Experience with previous IT projects (CRM, ERP modules, new software): High upfront costs, ongoing licenses, no proven productivity gain
- Fear of AI projects that buy expensive tools and consulting but deliver no solid savings numbers
- CFO/Management blocks further budgets when ROI is not measurable
- **Expectation:** Clear before/after calculation per process (time savings, costs, quality)

### Pain Point #2 - Dependency on Few Experts

- Critical processes depend on know-how of 2-3 key people
- Risks: Illness, retirement, resignation → process breaks down
- These people are overloaded with ongoing work and block improvements
- Operational knowledge is in heads, not in the system (special cases, workarounds, implicit rules)

### Pain Point #3 - Missing Process Documentation

- Processes are "somehow known" but: not standardized, not currently documented, not audit-safe (GoBD, ISO, internal audit)
- Onboarding new employees takes long; error rate increases in peak times
- Without documented processes, automation and AI deployment are barely possible

---

## ROI Requirements

### Core Assumption

AI/Automation only worth it if hard business metrics improve:
- Hours saved per week/month
- Reduction in FTE need or avoided new hires
- Reduced error rate (complaints, correction runs)
- Throughput times / Lead times (e.g., time from invoice receipt to payment)

### ROI Expectation

At least **2-3x project costs within 12 months** (ROI ≥200%)

### Example ROI Logic (Automated Ticket/Case Creation)

- Before: 10 minutes manual processing per case
- After: 3 minutes remaining effort (check + save)
- Savings: 7 minutes per case
- At 100 cases/month and €30/h: ~€350/month → **~€4,000/year** for just this process
- Project costs (one-time) of €1,800-2,500 amortized within a few months

---

## Trigger Moments for Purchase Readiness

1. Overtime and burnout risk in back-office, despite new hires
2. CFO/Management demands **concrete cost reduction** instead of more headcount
3. Upcoming retirement or departure of a key person in accounting/back-office
4. External audit, ISO or GoBD audit shows processes and documentation are insufficient
5. Management wants to "test AI practically and small now" instead of financing a large transformation plan
6. Internal efficiency/automation initiatives but missing structure, prioritization, and resources

---

## Non-Target Customers (Explicit Exclusion)

- **Automation agencies, IT service providers, software houses, SaaS providers, RPA providers, n8n specialists** - Risk of know-how drain, more competitors than customers
- **Startups with <20 employees** without clearly defined processes
- Companies primarily interested in "AI gimmicks" without clear business case or willingness for ROI measurement
- Organizations with heavily regulated but fully standardized corporate processes that already have internal automation/shared service centers

---

## Our Product: 30-Day Automation Pilot

### Product Core

- Selection of a **concrete routine process** with high volume and clear repeatability
- Examples: Incoming invoice processing, bug ticket creation, master data setup, recurring reporting processes

### In 30 Days

1. A productive, AI-supported workflow is implemented (e.g., with n8n + LLM agents)
2. The process is documented license-free (process steps, rules, special cases)
3. A ROI baseline before/after pilot is determined (time, costs, quality)

### Key Benefits for ICP

- **Measurable ROI:** Before/after metrics are part of the project, not "optional"
- **Knowledge security:** Implicit know-how of experts is transferred into process logic and documentation
- **Cushion skill shortage:** Automation reduces routine work; onboarding new employees becomes easier
- **Data sovereignty & tech stack:** Solution can run in existing infrastructure; no vendor lock-in

### Pricing

€1,800 - €2,500 (fixed price, 30-day project)

## Email Outreach Messaging

### Entry via Pain + ROI

> "How many hours per month does your team lose on [invoice processing/bug tickets/utility billing] – and how much of that could be automated?"

### Safety Frame

> "No major project, no annual contract – a clearly defined 30-day pilot with fixed price (€1,800-2,500) and measurable metrics."

### Knowledge Security & Skill Shortage

> "We get your experts' knowledge out of their heads into a documented, automated process – before someone retires."

| Process Inefficiency | €50,000+/year | Delays, errors, manual work |
| CEO Time Waste | €80,000/year | CEO spending 16h/week on manual reports × €100/h |

## DACH Region Specifics

- **Risk Averse:** High value on stability; prefer proven solutions over "cutting edge"
- **Bureaucracy:** Slow decision-making processes involving boards and multiple stakeholders
- **Legacy Culture:** "We've always done it this way" makes innovation difficult
- **Compliance:** Strict adherence to GDPR and data residency is non-negotiable
- **Local Trust:** Distrust of international vendors; preference for local/German-speaking partners
- **Language:** Executives speak English but prefer German for complex business contracts
